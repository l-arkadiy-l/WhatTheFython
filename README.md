`WTF --> What The Fython`

This crazy library is created for you to enjoy it.
In this ~~funny~~ serious library lets you to _add_ or _subtract_ tuples, lists and etc.

```
from Tuples.main_tuple import *

if __name__ == '__main__':
    tup1 = Tuple((2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 8))
    tup2 = Tuple((3, '4', 2, 6, 7, 2, '4f5'))
    print(tup1 + tup2)
    print(tup1 - tup2)
    print(tup1 // tup2)
```
result == `(5, 7, 6, 12, 14, 9, 53)
(-1, -1, 2, 0, 0, 5, -37)
(0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0)`
